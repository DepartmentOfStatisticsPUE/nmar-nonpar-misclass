# Outline of the paper


## Simulation study

We conduct two limited simulation studies

1. Replicate Riddels, Kim and Im (2016) simulation study II assuming mis-classification in x1, x2 and y.
2. New simulation study where X is categorical variable with h number of classes and Y is variable with 3 categories.
